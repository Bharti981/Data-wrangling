# Data-wrangling- 
Data wrangling, also known as data munging, involves gathering, collecting, and transforming raw data into another format for better understanding, decision-making, analysis, and accessibility. Data wrangling helps sort and analyze the raw data to achieve this goal.
Data acquisition refers to the process of collecting data from various sources (e.g., databases) and integrating it into a usable format. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and regular expressions simplify data acquisition tasks.
